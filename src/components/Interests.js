      <h3>Non-Tech Things I Like</h3>
      <div className="right-hand-project project-container">
        <h5>Fencing</h5>
        <img src=""></img>
        <p>
          I used to fence internationally and have represented both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since I stopped competeing, I&apos;ve qualified as an international referee and have been fortunate enought to referee at the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Paralympic games.

        <h5>Japan</h5>
        <img src=""></img>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve lived in Japan a couple of times and can speak Japanese to a high level. I helped organisations such as the RFU and British Olympic Association and British Paralympic Assosication prepare for Tokyo 2020 and the Rugby World Cup 2019 and ran the Japanese Sport Stories Podcast with SOAS University and Paralympian Noel Thatcher. I love Japanese literature, especially Sayaka Murata and Yu Miri, and Japanese movies/cheesy dramas.

        <p>
          Me and my partner work with Kent Greyhound Rescue as foster carers - we help newly rescued dogs settle into home-lives for the first times to give them the best chance of being adopted. We also have our own rescue, Bob. A constant backround companion throughout my coding sessions.
